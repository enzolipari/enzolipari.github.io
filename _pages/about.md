I am a senior researcher at the [National Institute of Oceanography and Applied Geophysics - OGS](https://www.ogs.it). 
My goal is to achieve advancements in geophysical signal processing, exploration seismology, and mathematical modeling, while contributing to the sustainable development and management of the Earth's resources and environment.
