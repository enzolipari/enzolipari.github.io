I am a senior researcher at the [National Institute of Oceanography and Applied Geophysics - OGS](https://www.ogs.it),  a leading Italian research institute in geosciences and environmental sciences. I apply my expertise in signal processing, inverse problems, machine learning, and applied mathematics to develop innovative solutions for the exploration and monitoring of natural resources and geological hazards.

My goal is to achieve advancements in geophysical signal processing, exploration seismology and mathematical modeling, while contributing to the sustainable development and management of the Earth's resources and environment.
