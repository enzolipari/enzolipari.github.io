I am a senior researcher at the [National Institute of Oceanography and Applied Geophysics - OGS](https://www.ogs.it). 
My goal is to achieve advancements in geophysical signal processing, exploration seismology, and mathematical modeling, while contributing to the sustainable development and management of the Earth's resources and environment.


Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
