  abstract = {Self-supervised methods have recently proved to be nearly as effective as supervised methods in various imaging inverse problems, paving the way for learning-based methods in scientific and medical imaging applications where ground truth data is hard or expensive to obtain. This is the case in magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. These methods critically rely on invariance to translations and/or rotations of the image distribution to learn from incomplete measurement data alone. However, existing approaches fail to obtain competitive performances in the problems of image super-resolution and deblurring, which play a key role in most imaging systems. In this work, we show that invariance to translations and rotations is insufficient to learn from measurements that only contain low-frequency information. Instead, we propose a new self-supervised approach that leverages the fact that many image distributions are approximately scale-invariant, and that can be applied to any inverse problem where high-frequency information is lost in the measurement process. We demonstrate throughout a series of experiments on real datasets that the proposed method outperforms other self-supervised approaches, and obtains performances on par with fully supervised learning.},

  abstract={Because of the restriction of complex field conditions and economic circumstance, seismic data is usually undersampled in the spatial domain, which needs to be interpolated to meet the requirements of following seismic data processing such as seismic imaging. We present a seismic data interpolation method via an end-to-end self-supervised deep learning framework. Specifically, a CNN is trained only using the observed undersampled seismic data itself. Furthermore, based on the equivariance of seismic data with respect to shift and undersampling, a training strategy that enforces both the measurement consistency and the equivalence is utilized. Experiments on regularly undersampled synthetic and field data interpolation show the effectiveness of our presented method in comparison with deep image prior (DIP) based interpolation method.},
